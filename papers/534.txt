Emotional color transfer aims to change the evoked emotion of a source image to that of a target image by adjusting color distribution. Most of existing emotional color transfer methods only consider the low-level visual features of an image and ignore the facial expression features when the image contains a human face, which would cause incorrect emotion evaluation for the given image. In addition, previous emotional color transfer methods may easily result in ambiguity between the emotion of resulting image and target image. For example, if the background of the target image is dark while the facial expression is happiness, then previous methods would directly transfer dark color to the source image, neglecting the facial emotion in the image. To solve this problem, we propose a new facial-expression-aware emotional color transfer framework. Given a target image with facial expression features, we first predict the facial emotion label of the image through the emotion classification network. Then, facial emotion labels are matched with pre-trained emotional color transfer models. Finally, we use the matched emotion model to transfer the color of the target image to the source image. Considering none of the existing emotion image databases, which focus on images that contain face and background, we built an emotion database for our new emotional color transfer framework that is called “Face-Emotion database.” Experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully capture and transfer facial emotions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

As an emerging computer vision task, crowd localization has received increasing attention due to its ability to produce more accurate spatially predictions. However, continuous scale variations in complex crowd scenes lead to tiny individuals at the edges, so that existing methods cannot achieve precise crowd localization. Aiming at alleviating the above problems, we propose a novel Dilated Convolution-based Feature Refinement Network (DFRNet) to enhance the representation learning capability. Specifically, the DFRNet is built with three branches, which can capture the information of each individual in crowd scenes more precisely. More specifically, we introduce a Feature Perception Module (FPM) to model long-range contextual information at different scales by adopting multiple dilated convolutions, thus providing sufficient feature information to perceive tiny individuals at the edge of images. Afterwards, a Feature Refinement Module (FRM) is deployed at multiple stages of the three branches to facilitate the mutual refinement of feature information at different scales, thus further improving the expression capability of multi-scale contextual information. By incorporating the above modules, DFRNet can locate individuals in complex scenes more precise. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has more advanced performance compared to existing methods and can be more accurately adapted to complex crowd scenes.

Resource optimization algorithm based on clustering and improved differential evolution strategy, as a new global optimized algorithm, has wide applications in language translation, language processing, document understanding, cloud computing, and edge computing due to high efficiency. With the development of deep learning technology and the rise of big data, the resource optimization algorithm encounters a series of challenges, such as the workload imbalance and low resource utilization. To address the preceding problems, this study proposes a novel resource optimization algorithm based on clustering and an improved differential evolution strategy (Multi-objective Task Scheduling Strategy (MTSS)). Three indexes, namely task completion time, execution cost, and workload, of virtual machines are selected and used to build the fitness function of the MTSS algorithm. At the same time, the preprocessing state is set up to cluster according to the resource and task characteristics to reduce the magnitude of their matching scale. Moreover, to solve the workload imbalance among different resource sets, local resource tasks are reallocated using the Q-value method in the MTSS strategy to achieve workload balance of global resources and improve the resource utilization rate. Experiments are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of task completion time, execution cost, and workload balancing.

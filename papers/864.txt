Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people around the world and cannot be cured fundamentally. Automatic identification of early Parkinson's disease on feature data sets is one of the most challenging medical tasks today. Many features in these datasets are useless or suffering from problems like noise, which affect the learning process and increase the computational burden. To ensure the optimal classification performance, this article proposes a hybrid feature selection algorithm based on an improved discrete artificial bee colony algorithm to improve the efficiency of feature selection. The algorithm combines the advantages of filters and wrappers to eliminate most of the uncorrelated or noisy features and determine the optimal subset of features. In the filter, three different variable ranking methods are employed to pre-rank the candidate features, then the population of artificial bee colony is initialized based on the significance degree of the re-rank features. In the wrapper part, the artificial bee colony algorithm evaluates individuals (feature subsets) based on the classification accuracy of the classifier to achieve the optimal feature subset. In addition, for the first time, we introduce a strategy that can automatically select the best classifier in the search framework more quickly. By comparing with several publicly available datasets, the proposed method achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art algorithms and can extract fewer effective features.

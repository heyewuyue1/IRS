For guiding natural language generation, many semantic-driven methods have been proposed. While clearly improving the performance of the end-to-end training task, these existing semantic-driven methods still have clear limitations: for example, (i) they only utilize shallow semantic signals (e.g., from topic models) with only a single stochastic hidden layer in their data generation process, which suffer easily from noise (especially adapted for short-text etc.) and lack of interpretation; (ii) they ignore the sentence order and document context, as they treat each document as a bag of sentences, and fail to capture the long-distance dependencies and global semantic meaning of a document. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel semantic-driven language modeling framework, which is a method to learn a Hierarchical Language Model and a Recurrent Conceptualization-enhanced Gamma Belief Network, simultaneously. For scalable inference, we develop the auto-encoding Variational Recurrent Inference, allowing efficient end-to-end training and simultaneously capturing global semantics from a text corpus. Especially, this article introduces concept information derived from high-quality lexical knowledge graph Probase, which leverages strong interpretability and anti-nose capability for the proposed model. Moreover, the proposed model captures not only intra-sentence word dependencies, but also temporal transitions between sentences and inter-sentence concept dependence. Experiments conducted on several NLP tasks validate the superiority of the proposed approach, which could effectively infer meaningful hierarchical concept structure of document and hierarchical multi-scale structures of sequences, even compared with latest state-of-the-art Transformer-based models.

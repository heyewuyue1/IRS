Nowadays, the problem of automating the software delivery processes and resource configuring in computing environments with parallel and distributed architectures to ensure the functioning of digital twins is highly relevant. A large spectrum of the well-known tools for software configuration management is available. However, most of them do not solve problems emerging in the considered subject domain fully. To this end, we propose a new framework for implementing preparing, debugging, delivering, testing, deploying, and configuring virtualized software of digital twins. Currently, we are developing such twins for analyzing the operation of environmentally friendly equipment of infrastructural objects located in the Baikal natural territory. The proposed framework is based on the integrated applying methods and tools of knowledge engineering, multi-agent technologies, conceptual and service-oriented programming, and administration of hybrid distributed computing systems. These systems can include both personal resources and resources of public access centers, grid systems, and cloud or fog platforms. We carried out the practical experiments with the framework prototype. The obtained results have shown that significant speedup in performing the aforementioned processes can be achieved.

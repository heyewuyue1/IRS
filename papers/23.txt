Smart cities fully utilize the new generation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the process of urban informatization to optimize the urban management and service. However, in the IoT system, while information exchange and communication, wireless sensor network devices may not be able to resist all forms of attacks, which may lead to security issues such as user data disclosure. Aiming at the information security risks in smart city, the typical technologies in IoT is analyzed from the perspective of IoT perception layer and provides corresponding security solutions for the existing security threats. Regarding the communication security, the emerging wireless technology, long range (LoRa), is discussed, and the performance of wireless communication protocol is analyzed through simulation experiments, to verify that the IoT technology based on LoRa communication technology can improve the security of the system in the construction of smart city. The results show that REBEB, a new backoff algorithm, is similar to the binary exponential backoff algorithm in terms of throughput performance. REBEB focuses more on fairness, which is up to 0.985, and to a certain extent, its security is significantly improved. The fairness of REBEB algorithm is more than 0.4 in different nodes and competing windows, and the fairness of the system is better when the number of nodes is small. To sum up, the IoT system based on LoRa communication can effectively improve the security performance of the system in the construction of smart city and avoid the security threats in the IoT signal transmission.

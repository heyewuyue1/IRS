Graphs can represent relational information among entities and graph structures are widely used in many intelligent tasks such as search, recommendation, and question answering. However, most of the graph-structured data in practice suffer from incompleteness, and thus link prediction becomes an important research problem. Though many models are proposed for link prediction, the following two problems are still less explored: (1) Most methods model each link independently without making use of the rich information from relevant links, and (2) existing models are mostly designed based on associative learning and do not take reasoning into consideration. With these concerns, in this paper, we propose Graph Collaborative Reasoning (GCR), which can use the neighbor link information for relational reasoning on graphs from logical reasoning perspectives. We provide a simple approach to translate a graph structure into logical expressions so that the link prediction task can be converted into a neural logic reasoning problem. We apply logical constrained neural modules to build the network architecture according to the logical expression and use backpropagation to efficiently learn the model parameters, which bridges differentiable learning and symbolic reasoning in a unified architecture. To show the effectiveness of our work, we conduct experiments on graph-related tasks such as link prediction and recommendation based on commonly used benchmark datasets, and our graph collaborative reasoning approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

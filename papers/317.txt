With the rapidly growing attention to multi-view data in recent years, multi-view outlier detection has become a rising field with intense research. These researches have made some success, but still exist some issues that need to be solved. First, many multi-view outlier detection methods can only handle datasets that conform to the cluster structure but are powerless for complex data distributions such as manifold structures. This overly restrictive data assumption limits the applicability of these methods. In addition, almost the majority of multi-view outlier detection algorithms cannot solve the online detection problem of multi-view outliers. To address these issues, we propose a new detection method based on the local similarity relation and data reconstruction, i.e., the Self-Representation Method with Local Similarity Preserving for fast multi-view outlier detection (SRLSP). By using the local similarity structure, the proposed method fully utilizes the characteristics of outliers and detects outliers with an applicable objective function. Besides, a well-designed optimization algorithm is proposed, which completes each iteration with linear time complexity and can calculate each instance parallelly. Also, the optimization algorithm can be easily extended to the online version, which is more suitable for practical production environments. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on both performance and time complexity.

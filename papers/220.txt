Smartwatches or fitness trackers have garnered a lot of popularity as potential health tracking devices due to their affordable and longitudinal monitoring capabilities. To further widen their health tracking capabilities, in recent years researchers have started to look into the possibility of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection in real-time leveraging photoplethysmography (PPG) data, an inexpensive sensor widely available in almost all smartwatches. A significant challenge in AF detection from PPG signals comes from the inherent noise in the smartwatch PPG signals. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning based approach, BayesBeat that leverages the power of Bayesian deep learning to accurately infer AF risks from noisy PPG signals, and at the same time provides an uncertainty estimate of the prediction. Extensive experiments on two publicly available dataset reveal that our proposed method BayesBeat outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, BayesBeat is substantially more efficient having 40--200X fewer parameters than state-of-the-art baseline approaches making it suitable for deployment in resource constrained wearable devices.

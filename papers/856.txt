Rehabilitation is a crucial process for patients suffering from motor disorders. The current practice is performing rehabilitation exercises under clinical expert supervision. New approaches are needed to allow patients to perform prescribed exercises at their homes and alleviate commuting requirements, expert shortages, and healthcare costs. Human joint estimation is a substantial component of these programs since it offers valuable visualization and feedback based on body movements. Camera-based systems have been popular for capturing joint motion. However, they have high-cost, raise serious privacy concerns, and require strict lighting and placement settings. We propose a millimeter-wave (mmWave)-based assistive rehabilitation system (MARS) for motor disorders to address these challenges. MARS provides a low-cost solution with a competitive object localization and detection accuracy. It first maps the 5D time-series point cloud from mmWave to a lower dimension. Then, it uses a convolution neural network (CNN) to estimate the accurate location of human joints. MARS can reconstruct 19 human joints and their skeleton from the point cloud generated by mmWave radar. We evaluate MARS using ten specific rehabilitation movements performed by four human subjects involving all body parts and obtain an average mean absolute error of 5.87 cm for all joint positions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rehabilitation movements dataset using mmWave point cloud. MARS is evaluated on the Nvidia Jetson Xavier-NX board. Model inference takes only 64 \(\)s and consumes 442 \(\)J energy. These results demonstrate the practicality of MARS on low-power edge devices.

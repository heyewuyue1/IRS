Question generation is an important yet challenging problem in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which aims to generate natural and relevant questions from various input formats, e.g., natural language text, structure database, knowledge base, and image. In this article, we focus on question generation from natural language text, which has received tremendous interest in recent years due to the widespread applications such as data augmentation for question answering systems. During the past decades, many different question generation models have been proposed, from traditional rule-based methods to advanced neural network-based methods. Since there have been a large variety of research works proposed, we believe it is the right time to summarize the current status, learn from existing methodologies, and gain some insights for future development. In contrast to existing reviews, in this survey, we try to provide a more comprehensive taxonomy of question generation tasks from three different perspectives, i.e., the types of the input context text, the target answer, and the generated question. We take a deep look into existing models from different dimensions to analyze their underlying ideas, major design principles, and training strategies We compare these models through benchmark tasks to obtain an empirical understanding of the existing techniques. Moreover, we discuss what is missing in the current literature and what are the promising and desired future directions.

In multi-label classification, the task is to induce predictive models which can assign a set of relevant labels for the unseen instance. The strategy of label-specific features has been widely employed in learning from multi-label examples, where the classification model for predicting the relevancy of each class label is induced based on its tailored features rather than the original features. Existing approaches work by generating a group of tailored features for each class label independently, where label correlations are not fully considered in the label-specific features generation process. In this article, we extend existing strategy by proposing a simple yet effective approach based on BiLabel-specific features. Specifically, a group of tailored features is generated for a pair of class labels with heuristic prototype selection and embedding. Thereafter, predictions of classifiers induced by BiLabel-specific features are ensembled to determine the relevancy of each class label for unseen instance. To thoroughly evaluate the BiLabel-specific features strategy, extensive experiments are conducted over a total of 35 benchmark datasets. Comparative studies against state-of-the-art label-specific features techniques clearly validate the superiority of utilizing BiLabel-specific features to yield stronger generalization performance for multi-label classification.

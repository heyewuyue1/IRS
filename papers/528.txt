Multi-source domain adaptation is a challenging topic in transfer learning, especially when the data of each domain are represented by different kinds of features, i.e., Multi-source Heterogeneous Domain Adaptation (MHDA). It is important to take advantage of the knowledge extracted from multiple sources as well as bridge the heterogeneous spaces for handling the MHDA paradigm. This article proposes a novel method named Multiple Graphs and Low-rank Embedding (MGLE), which models the local structure information of multiple domains using multiple graphs and learns the low-rank embedding of the target domain. Then, MGLE augments the learned embedding with the original target data. Specifically, we introduce the modules of both domain discrepancy and domain relevance into the multiple graphs and low-rank embedding learning procedure. Subsequently, we develop an iterative optimization algorithm to solve the resulting problem. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several real-world datasets. Promising results show that the performance of MGLE is better than that of the baseline methods in terms of several metrics, such as AUC, MAE, accuracy, precision, F1 score, and MCC, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The U-Net has become the most popular structure in medical image segmentation in recent years. Although its performance for medical image segmentation is outstanding, a large number of experiments demonstrate that the classical U-Net network architecture seems to be insufficient when the size of segmentation targets changes and the imbalance happens between target and background in different forms of segmentation. To improve the U-Net network architecture, we develop a new architecture named densely connected U-Net (DenseUNet) network in this article. The proposed DenseUNet network adopts a dense block to improve the feature extraction capability and employs a multi-feature fuse block fusing feature maps of different levels to increase the accuracy of feature extraction. In addition, in view of the advantages of the cross entropy and the dice loss functions, a new loss function for the DenseUNet network is proposed to deal with the imbalance between target and background. Finally, we test the proposed DenseUNet network and compared it with the multi-resolutional U-Net (MultiResUNet) and the classic U-Net networks on three different datasets. The experimental results show that the DenseUNet network has significantly performances compared with the MultiResUNet and the classic U-Net networks.

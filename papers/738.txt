Recent advancements in deep learning architecture have increased its utility in real-life applications. Deep learning models require a large amount of data to train the model. In many application domains, there is a limited set of data available for training neural networks as collecting new data is either not feasible or requires more resources such as in marketing, computer vision, and medical science. These models require a large amount of data to avoid the problem of overfitting. One of the data space solutions to the problem of limited data is data augmentation. The purpose of this study focuses on various data augmentation techniques that can be used to further improve the accuracy of a neural network. This saves the cost and time consumption required to collect new data for the training of deep neural networks by augmenting available data. This also regularizes the model and improves its capability of generalization. The need for large datasets in different fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, security, and healthcare is also covered in this survey paper. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in data augmentation techniques and their application in various domains.

Sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) is a major algorithmic trajectory planning approach in autonomous driving given its high efficiency and outstanding performance in practice. However, driving safety still calls for further refinement of SBMP. In this article we organically integrate algorithmic motion planning with learning models to improve SBMP in highway traffic scenarios from the following two perspectives. First, given the number of points to be sampled, we develop a new model to sample “important” points for SBMP by predicting the intention of surrounding vehicles and learning the distribution of human drivers’ trajectory. Second, we empirically study the relationship between the number of sample points and the environment, which is largely ignored in conventional SBMP. Then, we provide a guideline to select the appropriate number of points to be sampled under different scenarios to guarantee efficiency. The simulation experiments are conducted based on the vehicle trajectory dataset NGSIM. The results show that the proposed sampling strategy outperforms existing sampling strategies in terms of the computing time, traveling time, and smoothness of the trajectory.

Brain-Computer Interface is the collaboration of the human brain and a device that controls the actions of a human using brain signals. Applications of brain-computer interface vary from the field of entertainment to medical. In this article, a novel Deceit Identification Test is proposed based on the Electroencephalogram signals to identify and analyze the human behavior. Deceit identification test is based on P300 signals, which have a positive peak from 300 ms to 1,000 ms of the stimulus onset. The aim of the experiment is to identify and classify P300 signals with good classification accuracy. For preprocessing, a band-pass filter is used to eliminate the artifacts. The feature extraction is carried out using “symlet” Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT). Deep Neural Network (DNN) with two autoencoders having 10 hidden layers each is applied as the classifier. A novel experiment is conducted for the collection of EEG data from the subjects. EEG signals of 30 subjects (15 guilty and 15 innocent) are recorded and analyzed during the experiment. BrainVision recorder and analyzer are used for recording and analyzing EEG signals. The model is trained for 90% of the dataset and tested for 10% of the dataset and accuracy of 95% is obtained.

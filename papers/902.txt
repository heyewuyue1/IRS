Accurate citywide traffic inference is critical for improving intelligent transportation systems with smart city applications. However, this task is very challenging given the limited training data, due to the high cost of sensor installment and maintenance across the entire urban space. A more practical scenario to study the citywide traffic inference is effectively modeling the spatial and temporal traffic patterns with limited historical traffic observations. In this work, we propose a dynamic multi-view graph neural network for citywide traffic inference with the method CTVI+. Specifically, for the temporal dimension, we propose a temporal self-attention mechanism that is capable of learning the dynamics of traffic data with the time-evolving traffic volume variations. For spatial dimension, we build a multi-view graph neural network, employing the road-wise message passing scheme to capture the region dependencies. With the designed spatial-temporal learning paradigms, we enable our traffic inference model to encode the dynamism from both spatial and temporal traffic patterns, which is reflective of intra- and inter-road traffic correlations. In our evaluation, CTVI+ achieves consistent better performance compared with different baselines on real-world traffic volume datasets. Further ablation study validates the effectiveness of key components in CTVI+. We release the model implementation at https://github.com/dsj96/TKDD.

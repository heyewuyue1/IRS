Segmenting meaningful visual structures from an image is a fundamental and most-addressed problem in image analysis algorithms. However, among factors such as diverse visual patterns, noise, complex backgrounds, and similar textures present in foreground and background, image segmentation still stands as a challenging research problem. In this article, the proposed method employs an unsupervised method that addresses image segmentation as subspace clustering of image feature vectors. Initially, an image is partitioned into a set of homogeneous regions called superpixels, from which Local Spectral Histogram features are computed. Subsequently, a feature data matrix is created whereupon subspace clustering methodology is applied. A single-stage optimization model is formulated with enhanced segmentation capabilities by the combined action of l ½ and l 2 norm minimization. Robustness of l ½ regularization toward both the noise and overestimation of sparsity provides simultaneous noise robustness and better subspace selection, respectively. While l 2 norm facilitates grouping effect. Hence, the designed optimization model ensures an improved sparse solution and a sparse representation matrix with an accurate block diagonal structure, which thereby favours getting properly segmented images. Then, experimental results of the proposed method are compared with the state-of-art algorithms. Results demonstrate the improved performance of our method over the state-of-art algorithms.

The rise of digitization of cultural documents offers large-scale contents, opening the road for development of AI systems in order to preserve, search, and deliver cultural heritage. To organize such cultural content also means to classify them, a task that is very familiar to modern computer science. Contextual information is often the key to structure such real world data, and we propose to use it in form of a knowledge graph. Such a knowledge graph, combined with content analysis, enhances the notion of proximity between artworks so it improves the performances in classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel use of a knowledge graph, that is constructed on annotated data and pseudo-labeled data. With label propagation, we boost artwork classification by training a model using a graph convolutional network, relying on the relationships between entities of the knowledge graph. Following a transductive learning framework, our experiments show that relying on a knowledge graph modeling the relations between labeled data and unlabeled data allows to achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple classification tasks on a dataset of paintings, and on a dataset of Buddha statues. Additionally, we show state-of-the-art results for the difficult case of dealing with unbalanced data, with the limitation of disregarding classes with extremely low degrees in the knowledge graph.

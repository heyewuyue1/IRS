We introduce a novel embedding model, named NoGE, which aims to integrate co-occurrence among entities and relations into graph neural networks to improve knowledge graph completion (i.e., link prediction). Given a knowledge graph, NoGE constructs a single graph considering entities and relations as individual nodes. NoGE then computes weights for edges among nodes based on the co-occurrence of entities and relations. Next, NoGE proposes Dual Quaternion Graph Neural Networks (DualQGNN) and utilizes DualQGNN to update vector representations for entity and relation nodes. NoGE then adopts a score function to produce the triple scores. Comprehensive experimental results show that NoGE obtains state-of-the-art results on three new and difficult benchmark datasets CoDEx for knowledge graph completion.

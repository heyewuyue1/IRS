With the progress of Mars exploration, numerous Mars image data are being collected and need to be analyzed. However, due to the severe train-test gap and quality distortion of Martian data, the performance of existing computer vision models is unsatisfactory. In this article, we introduce a semi-supervised framework for machine vision on Mars and try to resolve two specific tasks: classification and segmentation. Contrastive learning is a powerful representation learning technique. However, there is too much information overlap between Martian data samples, leading to a contradiction between contrastive learning and Martian data. Our key idea is to reconcile this contradiction with the help of annotations and further take advantage of unlabeled data to improve performance. For classification, we propose to ignore inner-class pairs on labeled data as well as neglect negative pairs on unlabeled data, forming supervised inter-class contrastive learning and unsupervised similarity learning. For segmentation, we extend supervised inter-class contrastive learning into an element-wise mode and use online pseudo labels for supervision on unlabeled areas. Experimental results show that our learning strategies can improve the classification and segmentation models by a large margin and outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious viral disease affecting millions of people worldwide in 2020. Several studies have shown that COVID-19 results in a severe acute respiratory syndrome and may lead to death. In past research, a greater number of respiratory diseases has been caused by exposure to air pollution for long periods of time. This article investigates the spread of COVID-19 as a result of air pollution by applying linear regression in machine learning method based edge computing. The analysis in this investigation have been based on the death rates caused by COVID-19 as well as the region of death rates based on hazardous air pollution using data retrieved from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite. The results obtained in the investigation prove that the mortality rate due to the spread of COVID-19 is 77% higher in areas with polluted air. This investigation also proves that COVID-19 severely affected 68% of the individuals who had been exposed to polluted air.

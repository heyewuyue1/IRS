Preprocessing of input text can play a key role in text classification by reducing dimensionality and removing unnecessary content. This study aims to investigate the impact of preprocessing on Arabic offensive language classification. We explore six preprocessing techniques: conversion of emojis to Arabic textual labels, normalization of different forms of Arabic letters, normalization of selected nouns from dialectal Arabic to Modern Standard Arabic, conversion of selected hyponyms to hypernyms, hashtag segmentation, and basic cleaning such as removing numbers, kashidas, diacritics, and HTML tags. We also experiment with raw text and a combination of all six preprocessing techniques. We apply different types of classifiers in our experiments including traditional machine learning, ensemble machine learning, Artificial Neural Networks, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based models to analyze the impact of preprocessing. Our results demonstrate significant variations in the effects of preprocessing on each classifier type and on each dataset. Classifiers that are based on BERT do not benefit from preprocessing, while traditional machine learning classifiers do. However, these results can benefit from validation on larger datasets that cover broader domains and dialects.

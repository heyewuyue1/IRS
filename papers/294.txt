Background: Underwater images, in general, suffer from low contrast and high color distortions due to the non-uniform attenuation of the light as it propagates through the water. In addition, the degree of attenuation varies with the wavelength, resulting in the asymmetric traversing of colors. Despite the prolific works for underwater image restoration (UIR) using deep learning, the above asymmetricity has not been addressed in the respective network engineering. Contributions: As the first novelty, this article shows that attributing the right receptive field size ( context ) based on the traversing range of the color channel may lead to a substantial performance gain for the task of UIR. Further, it is important to suppress the irrelevant multi-contextual features and increase the representational power of the model. Therefore, as a second novelty, we have incorporated an attentive skip mechanism to adaptively refine the learned multi-contextual features. The proposed framework, called Deep WaveNet , is optimized using the traditional pixel-wise and feature-based cost functions. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out to show the efficacy of the proposed scheme over existing best-published literature on benchmark datasets. More importantly, we have demonstrated a comprehensive validation of enhanced images across various high-level vision tasks, e.g., underwater image semantic segmentation and diverâ€™s 2D pose estimation. A sample video to exhibit our real-world performance is available at https://tinyurl.com/yzcrup9n . Also, we have open-sourced our framework at https://github.com/pksvision/Deep-WaveNet-Underwater-Image-Restoration .

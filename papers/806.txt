As an important topic in the multimedia and computer vision fields, salient object detection has been researched for years. Recently, state-of-the-art performance has been witnessed with the aid of the fully convolutional networks (FCNs) and the various pyramid-like encoder-decoder frameworks. Starting from a common encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance a residual refinement network with feature purification for better saliency estimation. To this end, we improve the global knowledge streams with intermediate supervisions for global saliency estimation and design a specific feature subtraction module for residual learning, respectively. On the basis of the strengthened network, we also introduce an attribute encoding sub-network (AENet) with a grid aggregation block (GAB) to guide the final saliency predictor to obtain more accurate saliency maps. Furthermore, the network is trained with a novel constraint loss besides the traditional cross-entropy loss to yield the finer results. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks show our method achieves better or comparable performance compared with previous state-of-the-art methods.

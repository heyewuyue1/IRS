Using unsupervised learning methods for clinical diagnosis is very meaningful. In this study, we propose an unsupervised multi-view & multi-medoid variant-entropy-based fuzzy clustering (M 2 VEFC) method for epilepsy EEG signals detecting. Comparing with existing related studies, M 2 VEFC has four main merits and contributions: (1) Features in original EEG data are represented from different perspectives that can provide more pattern information for epilepsy signals detecting. (2) During multi-view modeling, multi-medoids are used to capture the structure of clusters in each view. Furthermore, we assume that the medoids in a cluster observed from different views should keep invariant, which is taken as one of the collaborative learning mechanisms in this study. (3) A variant entropy is designed as another collaborative learning mechanism in which view weight learning is controlled by a user-free parameter. The parameter is derived from the distribution of samples in each view such that the learned weights have more discrimination. (4) M 2 VEFC does not need original data as its inputâ€”it only needs a similarity matrix and feature statistical information. Therefore, the original data are not exposed to users and hence the privacy is protected. We use several different kinds of feature extraction techniques to extract several groups of features as multi-view data from original EEG data to test the proposed method M 2 VEFC. Experimental results indicate M 2 VEFC achieves a promising performance that is better than benchmarking models.

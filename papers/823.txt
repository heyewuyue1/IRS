From facial recognition to autonomous driving, Artificial Intelligence (AI) will transform the way we live and work over the next couple of decades. Existing AI approaches for urban computing suffer from various challenges, including dealing with synchronization and processing of vast amount of data generated from the edge devices, as well as the privacy and security of individual users, including their bio-metrics, locations, and itineraries. Traditional centralized-based approaches require data in each organization be uploaded to the central database, which may be prohibited by data protection acts, such as GDPR and CCPA. To decouple model training from the need to store the data in the cloud, a new training paradigm called Federated Learning (FL) is proposed. FL enables multiple devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping the training data on devices locally, which can significantly mitigate privacy leakage risk. However, under urban computing scenarios, data are often communication-heavy, high-frequent, and asynchronized, posing new challenges to FL implementation. To handle these challenges, we propose a new hybrid federated learning architecture called StarFL. By combining with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and (Beidou) satellites, StarFL enables safe key distribution, encryption, and decryption, and provides a verification mechanism for each participant to ensure the security of the local data. In addition, StarFL can provide accurate timestamp matching to facilitate synchronization of multiple clients. All these improvements make StarFL more applicable to the security-sensitive scenarios for the next generation of urban computing.

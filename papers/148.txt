In dance training, it is necessary to carry out automatic trajectory tracking and feature analysis of movements, to carry out dance training guidance, and to propose a dance limb movement trajectory tracking method based on Kinect bone data. The multi-resolution frame scanning technology is adopted to collect machine images of dance limb movements, Kinect bone data feature detection is carried out on the collected high-resolution dance limb movement images, a three-dimensional reconstruction method of Kinect bone data is adopted to carry out region segmentation of dance limb movements, and a Kinect bone data tracking model is combined to realize machine vision block template matching processing of dance limb movements. Dancing limb motion trajectory tracking and feature extraction are carried out in Kinect bone data distribution space. Wavelet detection technology is used for fuzzy identification of dancing limb motion. Kinect bone data fusion is used to improve the resolution and adaptability of dancing limb motion trajectory tracking. Fuzzy image enhancement and feature point detection methods are used to realize optimization of dancing limb motion trajectory tracking. The simulation results show that this method has good adaptability and high degree of feature identification for dance limb movement trajectory tracking, which improves the ability of feature extraction and adaptive trajectory tracking of dance limb movement.

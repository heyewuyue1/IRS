Open Relation Extraction (ORE) plays a significant role in the field of Information Extraction. It breaks the limitation that traditional relation extraction must pre-define relational types in the annotated corpus and specific domains restrictions, to realize the goal of extracting entities and the relation between entities in the open domain. However, with the increase of sentence complexity, the precision and recall of Entity Relation Extraction will be significantly reduced. To solve this problem, we present an unsupervised Clause_CORE method based on Chinese grammar and dependency parsing features. Clause_CORE is used for complex sentences processing, including decomposing complex sentence and dynamically complementing sentence components, which can reduce sentences complexity and maintain the integrity of sentences at the same time. Then, we perform dependency parsing for complete sentences and implement open entity relation extraction based on the model constructed by Chinese grammar rules. The experimental results show that the performance of Clause_CORE method is better than that of other advanced Chinese ORE systems on Wikipedia and Sina news datasets, which proves the correctness and effectiveness of the method. The results on mixed datasets of news data and encyclopedia data prove the generalization and portability of the method.

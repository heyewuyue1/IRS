Logo detection has been gaining considerable attention because of its wide range of applications in the multimedia field, such as copyright infringement detection, brand visibility monitoring, and product brand management on social media. In this article, we introduce LogoDet-3K, the largest logo detection dataset with full annotation, which has 3,000 logo categories, about 200,000 manually annotated logo objects, and 158,652 images. LogoDet-3K creates a more challenging benchmark for logo detection, for its higher comprehensive coverage and wider variety in both logo categories and annotated objects compared with existing datasets. We describe the collection and annotation process of our dataset and analyze its scale and diversity in comparison to other datasets for logo detection. We further propose a strong baseline method Logo-Yolo, which incorporates Focal loss and CIoU loss into the basic YOLOv3 framework for large-scale logo detection. It obtains about 4% improvement on the average performance compared with YOLOv3, and greater improvements compared with reported several deep detection models on LogoDet-3K. We perform extensive evaluation on three other existing datasets to further verify on both logo detection and retrieval tasks, and we demonstrate better generalization ability of LogoDet-3K on logo detection and retrieval tasks. The LogoDet-3K dataset is used to promote large-scale logo-related research. The code and LogoDet-3K can be found at https://github.com/Wangjing1551/LogoDet-3K-Dataset.

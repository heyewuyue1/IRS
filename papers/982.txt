Deep Learning (DL) has been increasingly deployed in various real-world applications due to its unprecedented performance and automated capability of learning hidden representations. While DL can achieve high task performance, the training process of a DL model is both time- and resource-consuming. Therefore, current supply chains of the DL models assume the customers obtain pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) from the third-party providers that have sufficient computing power. In the centralized setting, the model designer trains the DL model using the local dataset. However, the collected training data may contain erroneous or poisoned data points. The model designer might craft malicious training samples and inject a backdoor in the DL model distributed to the users. As a result, the userâ€™s model will malfunction. In the federated learning setting, the cloud server aggregates local models trained on individual local datasets and updates the global model. In this scenario, the local client could poison the local training set and/or arbitrarily manipulate the local update. If the cloud server incorporates the malicious local gradients in model aggregation, the resulting global model will have degraded performance or backdoor behaviors. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of contemporary data poisoning and model poisoning attacks against DL models in both centralized and federated learning scenarios. In addition, we review existing detection and defense techniques against various poisoning attacks.

Person identification is a problem that has received substantial attention, particularly in security domains. Gait recognition is one of the most convenient approaches enabling person identification at a distance without the need for high-quality images. There are several review studies addressing person identification such as the utilization of facial images, silhouette images, and wearable sensor. Despite skeleton-based person identification gaining popularity while overcoming the challenges of traditional approaches, existing survey studies lack the comprehensive review of skeleton-based approaches to gait identification. We present a detailed review of the human pose estimation and gait analysis that makes the skeleton-based approaches possible. The study covers various types of related datasets, tools, methodologies, and evaluation metrics with associated challenges, limitations, and application domains. Detailed comparisons are presented for each of these aspects with recommendations for potential research and alternatives. A common trend throughout this paper is the positive impact that deep learning techniques are beginning to have on topics such as human pose estimation and gait identification. The survey outcomes might be useful for the related research community and other stakeholders in terms of performance analysis of existing methodologies, potential research gaps, application domains, and possible contributions in the future.

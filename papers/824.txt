Existing multi-turn context-response matching methods mainly concentrate on obtaining multi-level and multi-dimension representations and better interactions between context utterances and response. However, in real-place conversation scenarios, whether a response candidate is suitable not only counts on the given dialogue context but also other backgrounds, e.g., wording habits, user-specific dialogue history content. To fill the gap between these up-to-date methods and the real-world applications, we incorporate user-specific dialogue history into the response selection and propose a personalized hybrid matching network (PHMN). Our contributions are two-fold: (1) our model extracts personalized wording behaviors from user-specific dialogue history as extra matching information; (2) we perform hybrid representation learning on context-response utterances and explicitly incorporate a customized attention mechanism to extract vital information from context-response interactions so as to improve the accuracy of matching. We evaluate our model on two large datasets with user identification, i.e., personalized Ubuntu dialogue Corpus (P-Ubuntu) and personalized Weibo dataset (P-Weibo). Experimental results confirm that our method significantly outperforms several strong models by combining personalized attention, wording behaviors, and hybrid representation learning.

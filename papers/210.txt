Stomata is an important structure in all terrestrial plants and is very vital in controlling plant photosynthesis and transpiration flow. Precise detection of plant stomata is the basis for studying stomata characteristics. Traditional detection methods are mostly manual operations, which is a tedious and inefficient process. Manually extracting features requires high image quality. Choosing appropriate features depends on certain prior knowledge, especially for the object with large morphological changes such as plant stomata. With the widespread use of deep learning technology, efficient solutions to this task have become possible. This article combines the characteristics of the corn leaf stomatal data sets to improve the latest object detection model YOLO v5)You Only Look Once(. By introducing the attention mechanism, that is, adding the SE module to the backbone network, the precision and recall of stoma detection are improved. At the same time, The loss function has been improved from to for avoiding some problems that may occur when selecting the best prediction box. Experimental results show that the precision and recall rates of the improved model on the corn leaf stomata data sets have reached 94.8% and 98.7% respectively, lay the foundation for the measurement of stomatal parameters. In addition, this paper also can help agriculturists and botanists to build their own data sets for stomatal research by explaining the methods of acquiring, pre-processing, and annotating data sets.

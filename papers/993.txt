In this paper, we designed a partial discharge joint detection system combined of ultrasonic, infrared and ultraviolet detection system. In the system, we used ultrasonic positioning technology, ultraviolet and infrared detection technology. By the image registration and image fusion technology, we reached the implementation of ultrasonic, infrared and ultraviolet, joint portable on-line partial discharge detection system. This paper introduced the implementation of the three detection systems, the technology to mix up these three detection systems and the modular structure of each systems. Using the computer to fuse three kinds of partial discharge detection signal, we put the fused signal into the image of the camera and set up corresponding relation with the device image. System can not only respectively display each kinds of positioning imaging video signal, but also can merge three kinds of signal into one video interface and intuitively show the development and changes of partial discharge under three different types location detection methods. The system is convenient to carry, rapid in detection and it can find power equipment fault in time, which has extensive application value.

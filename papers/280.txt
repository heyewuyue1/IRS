As interest in machine learning and its applications becomes more widespread, how to choose the best models and hyper-parameter settings becomes more important. This problem is known to be challenging for human experts, and consequently, a growing number of methods have been proposed for solving it, giving rise to the area of automated machine learning (AutoML). Many of the most popular AutoML methods are based on Bayesian optimization, which makes only weak assumptions about how modifying hyper-parameters effects the loss of a model. This is a safe assumption that yields robust methods, as the AutoML loss landscapes that relate hyper-parameter settings to loss are poorly understood. We build on recent work on the study of one-dimensional slices of algorithm configuration landscapes by introducing new methods that test n -dimensional landscapes for statistical deviations from uni-modality and convexity, and we use them to show that a diverse set of AutoML loss landscapes are highly structured. We introduce a method for assessing the significance of hyper-parameter partial derivatives, which reveals that most (but not all) AutoML loss landscapes only have a small number of hyper-parameters that interact strongly. To further assess hyper-parameter interactions, we introduce a simplistic optimization procedure that assumes each hyper-parameter can be optimized independently, a single time in sequence, and we show that it obtains configurations that are statistically tied with optimal in all of the n -dimensional AutoML loss landscapes that we studied. Our results suggest many possible new directions for substantially improving the state of the art in AutoML.

A new causal discovery method is introduced to solve the bivariate causal discovery problem. The proposed algorithm leverages the expressive power of flow-based models and tries to learn the complex relationship between two variables. Algorithms have been developed to infer the causal direction according to empirical perturbation errors obtained from an invertible flow-based function. Theoretical results as well as experimental studies are presented to verify the proposed approach. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method could outperform baseline methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

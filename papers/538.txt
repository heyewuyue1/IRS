As an emerging initiative of proactive human resource management, employee turnover prediction is critically important for employers to retain talents and avoid the loss of intellectual capital. While considerable research efforts have been made in this direction, most of them only focus on modeling the within-company career trajectories of employees where the influence of external job market has been largely neglected. To this end, in this paper, we propose an enhanced framework of employee turnover prediction by jointly modeling the turnover clues from both internal and external views. Specifically, from the external-market view, we construct a heterogeneous graph which connects the employees with external job markets through shared skills. In this way, we can capture the potential popularity of employees in external markets specific to skills. Meanwhile, from the internal-company view, we design a graph convolutional network with hierarchical attention mechanism to capture the influence of organizational structure (e.g., superiors, subordinates, and peers) and colleagues with similar skills. Furthermore, both modules are modeled with Bidirectional LSTM and survival analysis to learn effective and dynamic representations of employee turnover prediction. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale real-world talent dataset with state-of-the-art methods, which clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach as well as some interesting findings that could help us understand the employee turnover patterns, such as different impacts of external systems and collaborators from different groups.

Due to the widespread deployment of fingerprint/face/speaker recognition systems, the risk in these systems, especially the adversarial attack, has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Previous researches mainly studied the adversarial attack to the vision-based systems, such as fingerprint and face recognition. While the attack for speech-based systems has not been well studied yet, although it has been widely used in our daily life. In this article, we attempt to fool the state-of-the-art speaker recognition model and present speaker recognition attacker , a lightweight multi-layer convolutional neural network to fool the well-trained state-of-the-art speaker recognition model by adding imperceptible perturbations onto the raw speech waveform. We find that the speaker recognition system is vulnerable to the adversarial attack, and achieve a high success rate on both the non-targeted attack and targeted attack. Besides, we present an effective method by leveraging a pretrained phoneme recognition model to optimize the speaker recognition attacker to obtain a tradeoff between the attack success rate and the perceptual quality. Experimental results on the TIMIT and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed model. And the experiments for frequency analysis indicate that high-frequency attack is more effective than low-frequency attack, which is different from the conclusion drawn in previous image-based works. Additionally, the ablation study gives more insights into our model.

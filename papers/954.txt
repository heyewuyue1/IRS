Image multi-label classification task is mainly to correctly predict multiple object categories in the images. To capture the correlation between labels, graph convolution network based methods have to manually count the label co-occurrence probability from training data to construct a pre-defined graph as the input of graph network, which is inflexible and may degrade model generalizability. Moreover, most of the current methods cannot effectively align the learned salient object features with the label concepts, so that the predicted results of model may not be consistent with the image content. Therefore, how to learn the salient semantic features of images and capture the correlation between labels, and then effectively align them is one of the key to improve the performance of image multi-label classification task. To this end, we propose a novel image multi-label classification framework which aims to align I mage S emantics with L abel C oncepts ( ISLC ). Specifically, we propose a residual encoder to learn salient object features in the images, and exploit the self-attention layer in aligned decoder to automatically capture the correlation between labels. Then, we leverage the cross-attention layers in aligned decoder to align image semantic features with label concepts, so as to make the labels predicted by model more consistent with image content. Finally, the output features of the last layer of residual encoder and aligned decoder are fused to obtain the final output feature for classification. The proposed ISLC model achieves good performance on various prevalent multi-label image datasets such as MS-COCO 2014, PASCAL VOC 2007, VG-500, and NUS-WIDE with 87.2%, 96.9%, 39.4%, and 64.2%, respectively.

Recently, many scene text detection algorithms have achieved impressive performance by using convolutional neural networks. However, most of them do not make full use of the context among the hierarchical multi-level features to improve the performance of scene text detection. In this article, we present an efficient multi-level features enhanced cumulative framework based on instance segmentation for scene text detection. At first, we adopt a Multi-Level Features Enhanced Cumulative ( MFEC ) module to capture features of cumulative enhancement of representational ability. Then, a Multi-Level Features Fusion ( MFF ) module is designed to fully integrate both high-level and low-level MFEC features, which can adaptively encode scene text information. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform experiments on six public datasets (namely, CTW1500, Total-text, MSRA-TD500, ICDAR2013, ICDAR2015, and MLT2017), and make comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-Level Features Enhanced Cumulative Network (MFECN) detector can well handle scene text instances with irregular shapes (i.e., curved, oriented, and horizontal) and achieves better or comparable results.

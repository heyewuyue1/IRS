Misinformation on social media has become a serious concern. Marking news stories with credibility indicators, possibly generated by an AI model, is one way to help people combat misinformation. In this paper, we report the results of two randomized experiments that aim to understand the effects of AI-based credibility indicators on people's perceptions of and engagement with the news, when people are under social influence such that their judgement of the news is influenced by other people. We find that the presence of AI-based credibility indicators nudges people into aligning their belief in the veracity of news with the AI model's prediction regardless of its correctness, thereby changing people's accuracy in detecting misinformation. However, AI-based credibility indicators show limited impacts on influencing people's engagement with either real news or fake news when social influence exists. Finally, it is shown that when social influence is present, the effects of AI-based credibility indicators on the detection and spread of misinformation are larger as compared to when social influence is absent, when these indicators are provided to people before they form their own judgements about the news. We conclude by providing implications for better utilizing AI to fight misinformation.

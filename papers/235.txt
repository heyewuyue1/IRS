While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has played an essential role in infant brain analysis, segmenting MRI into a number of tissues such as gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial and complex due to the extremely low intensity contrast between tissues at around 6--9 months of age as well as amplified noise, myelination, and incomplete volume. In this paper, we tackle those limitations by developing a new deep learning model, named DAM-AL, which contains two main contributions, i.e., dilated attention mechanism and hard-case attention loss. Our DAM-AL network is designed with skip block layers and atrous block convolution. It contains both channel-wise attention at high-level context features and spatial attention at low-level spatial structural features. Our attention loss consists of two terms corresponding to region information and hard samples attention. Our proposed DAM-AL has been evaluated on the infant brain iSeg 2017 dataset and the experiments have been conducted on both validation and testing sets. We have benchmarked DAM-AL on Dice coefficient and ASD metrics and compared it with state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/DinhHieuHoang/DAM-CA-InfantBrain

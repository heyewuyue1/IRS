How to accurately understand low-resource languages is the core of the task-oriented human-computer dialogue system. Language understanding consists of two sub-tasks, i.e., intent detection and slot filling. Intent detection still faces challenges due to semantic ambiguity and implicit intentions with usersâ€™ input. Moreover, separately modeling intent detection and slot filling significantly decrease the correctness and relevance between questions and answers. To address these issues, we propose a joint intent detection method using asynchronous training strategy. The proposed method firstly encodes local text information extracted by CNN and relationship information among words emphasized by attention structure. Later, a joint intent detection model with asynchronous training strategy is proposed by either fusing hidden states of intent detection and slot filling layers, or adopting the key information to fine-tune the whole network, greatly increasing the relevance of intent detection and slot filling subtasks. The accuracy achieved by the proposed method tested on an open-source airline travel dataset and a self-collected electricity service dataset, i.e., ATIS and ECSF, are 97.49% and 89.68%, respectively, which proves the effectiveness of joint learning and asynchronous training.

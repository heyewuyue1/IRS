Label Propagation AlgorithmÂ (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are both message passing algorithms on graphs. Both solve the task of node classification, but LPA propagates node label information across the edges of the graph, while GCN propagates and transforms node feature information. However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relationship between LPA and GCN has not yet been systematically investigated. Moreover, it is unclear how LPA and GCN can be combined under a unified framework to improve the performance. Here we study the relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of feature/label influence , in which we characterize how much the initial feature/label of one node influences the final feature/label of another node in GCN/LPA. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that combines GCN and LPA. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that lead to improved performance. Our model can also be seen as learning the weights of edges based on node labels, which is more direct and efficient than existing feature-based attention models or topology-based diffusion models. In a number of experiments for semi-supervised node classification and knowledge-graph-aware recommendation, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art baselines.

Machine learning components are essential for today’s software systems, causing a need to adapt traditional software engineering practices when developing machine-learning-based systems. This need is pronounced due to many development-related challenges of machine learning components such as asset, experiment, and dependency management. Recently, many asset management tools addressing these challenges have become available. It is essential to understand the support such tools offer to facilitate research and practice on building new management tools with native supports for machine learning and software engineering assets. This article positions machine learning asset management as a discipline that provides improved methods and tools for performing operations on machine learning assets. We present a feature-based survey of 18 state-of-practice and 12 state-of-research tools supporting machine-learning asset management. We overview their features for managing the types of assets used in machine learning experiments. Most state-of-research tools focus on tracking, exploring, and retrieving assets to address development concerns such as reproducibility, while the state-of-practice tools also offer collaboration and workflow-execution-related operations. In addition, assets are primarily tracked intrusively from the source code through APIs and managed via web dashboards or command-line interfaces (CLIs). We identify asynchronous collaboration and asset reusability as directions for new tools and techniques.

Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables numerous in-vehicle applications for smart cities, driving increasing service demands for processing various contents (e.g., videos). Generally, for efficient service delivery, the contents from the service providers are processed on the edge servers (ESs), as edge computing offers vehicular applications low-latency services. However, due to the reusability of the same contents required by different distributed vehicular users, processing the copies of the same contents repeatedly in an edge server leads to a waste of resources (e.g., storage, computation, and bandwidth) in ESs. Therefore, it is a challenge to provide high-quality services while guaranteeing the resource efficiency with edge content caching. To address the challenge, an edge content caching method for smart cities with service requirement prediction, named E-Cache, is proposed. First, the future service requirements from the vehicles are predicted based on the deep spatiotemporal residual network (ST-ResNet). Then, preliminary content caching schemes are elaborated based on the predicted service requirements, which are further adjusted by a many-objective optimization aiming at minimizing the execution time and the energy consumption of the vehicular services. Eventually, experimental evaluations prove the efficiency and effectiveness of E-Cache with spatiotemporal traffic trajectory big data.

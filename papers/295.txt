Detecting objects in aerial images is a long-standing and challenging problem since the objects in aerial images vary dramatically in size and orientation. Most existing neural network based methods are not robust enough to provide accurate oriented object detection results in aerial images since they do not consider the correlations between different levels and scales of features. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage network-based detector with a daptive f eature f usion towards highly accurate oriented object det ection in aerial images, named AFF-Det . First, a multi-scale feature fusion module (MSFF) is built on the top layer of the extracted feature pyramids to mitigate the semantic information loss in the small-scale features. We also propose a cascaded oriented bounding box regression method to transform the horizontal proposals into oriented ones. Then the transformed proposals are assigned to all feature pyramid network (FPN) levels and aggregated by the weighted RoI feature aggregation (WRFA) module. The above modules can adaptively enhance the feature representations in different stages of the network based on the attention mechanism. Finally, a rotated decoupled-RCNN head is introduced to obtain the classification and localization results. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed AFF-Det. The best detection results can achieve 80.73% mAP and 90.48% mAP, respectively, on these two datasets, outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods.

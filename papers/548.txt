Recently, concerning the challenge of collecting large-scale explicitly annotated videos, weakly supervised video object segmentation (WSVOS) using video tags has attracted much attention. Existing WSVOS approaches follow a general pipeline including two phases, i.e., a pseudo masks generation phase and a refinement phase. To explore the intrinsic property and correlation buried in the video frames, most of them focus on the later phase by introducing optical flow as temporal information to provide more supervision. However, these optical flow-based studies are greatly affected by illumination and distortion and lack consideration of the discriminative capacity of multi-level deep features. In this article, with the goal of capturing more effective temporal information and investigating a temporal information fusion strategy accordingly, we propose a unified WSVOS model by adopting a two-branch architecture with a multi-level cross-branch fusion strategy, named as dual-attention cross-branch fusion network (DACF-Net). Concretely, the two branches of DACF-Net, i.e., a temporal prediction subnetwork (TPN) and a spatial segmentation subnetwork (SSN), are used for extracting temporal information and generating predicted segmentation masks, respectively. To perform the cross-branch fusion between TPN and SSN, we propose a dual-attention fusion module that can be plugged into the SSN flexibly. We also pose a cross-frame coherence loss (CFCL) to achieve smooth segmentation results by exploiting the coherence of masks produced by TPN and SSN. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-arts on two challenging datasets, i.e., Davis-2016 and YouTube-Objects.

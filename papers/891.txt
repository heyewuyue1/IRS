Super-resolution methods for facial image via representation learning scheme have become very effective methods due to their efficiency. The key problem for the super-resolution of facial image is to reveal the latent relationship between the low-resolution ( LR ) and the corresponding high-resolution ( HR ) training patch pairs. To simultaneously utilize the contextual information of the target position and the manifold structure of the primitive HR space, in this work, we design a robust context-patch facial image super-resolution scheme via a kernel locality-constrained coupled-layer regression (KLC2LR) scheme to obtain the desired HR version from the acquired LR image. Here, KLC2LR proposes to acquire contextual surrounding patches to represent the target patch and adds an HR layer constraint to compensate the detail information. Additionally, KLC2LR desires to acquire more high-frequency information by searching for nearest neighbors in the HR sample space. We also utilize kernel function to map features in original low-dimensional space into a high-dimensional one to obtain potential nonlinear characteristics. Our compared experiments in the noisy and noiseless cases have verified that our suggested methodology performs better than many existing predominant facial image super-resolution methods.

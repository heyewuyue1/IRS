Dance challenges are going viral in video communities like TikTok nowadays. Once a challenge becomes popular, thousands of short-form videos will be uploaded within a couple of days. Therefore, virality prediction from dance challenges is of great commercial value and has a wide range of applications, such as smart recommendation and popularity promotion. In this article, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates skeletal, holistic appearance, facial and scenic cues is proposed for comprehensive dance virality prediction. To model body movements, we propose a pyramidal skeleton graph convolutional network (PSGCN) that hierarchically refines spatio-temporal skeleton graphs. Meanwhile, we introduce a relational temporal convolutional network (RTCN) to exploit appearance dynamics with non-local temporal relations. An attentive fusion approach is finally proposed to adaptively aggregate predictions from different modalities. To validate our method, we introduce a large-scale viral dance video (VDV) dataset, which contains over 4,000 dance clips of eight viral dance challenges. Extensive experiments on the VDV dataset well demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we show that short video applications such as multi-dimensional recommendation and action feedback can be derived from our model.

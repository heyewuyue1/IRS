Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has shown marvelous improvements across various NLP tasks, and its consecutive variants have been proposed to further improve the performance of the pre-trained language models. In this paper, we aim to first introduce the <italic>whole word masking</italic> (wwm) strategy for Chinese BERT, along with a series of Chinese pre-trained language models. Then we also propose a simple but effective model called MacBERT, which improves upon RoBERTa in several ways. Especially, we propose a new masking strategy called <italic>MLM as correction</italic> (Mac). To demonstrate the effectiveness of these models, we create a series of Chinese pre-trained language models as our baselines, including BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, RBT, etc. We carried out extensive experiments on ten Chinese NLP tasks to evaluate the created Chinese pre-trained language models as well as the proposed MacBERT. Experimental results show that MacBERT could achieve state-of-the-art performances on many NLP tasks, and we also ablate details with several findings that may help future research. We open-source our pre-trained language models for further facilitating our research community.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref>

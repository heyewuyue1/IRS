Tracking in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scenarios is one of the main components of target-tracking tasks. Different from the target-tracking task in the general scenarios, the target-tracking task in the UAV scenarios is very challenging because of factors such as small scale and aerial view. Although the discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based tracker has achieved good results in tracking tasks in general scenarios, the boundary effect caused by the dense sampling method will reduce the tracking accuracy, especially in UAV-tracking scenarios. In this work, we propose learning an adaptive spatial-temporal context-aware (ASTCA) model in the DCF-based tracking framework to improve the tracking accuracy and reduce the influence of boundary effect, thereby enabling our tracker to more appropriately handle UAV-tracking tasks. Specifically, our ASTCA model can learn a spatial-temporal context weight, which can precisely distinguish the target and background in the UAV-tracking scenarios. Besides, considering the small target scale and the aerial view in UAV-tracking scenarios, our ASTCA model incorporates spatial context information within the DCF-based tracker, which could effectively alleviate background interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ASTCA method performs favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods on some standard UAV datasets.

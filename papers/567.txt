Clinical-grade wearable sleep monitoring is a challenging problem since it requires concurrently monitoring brain activity, eye movement, muscle activity, cardio-respiratory features, and gross body movements. This requires multiple sensors to be worn at different locations as well as uncomfortable adhesives and discrete electronic components to be placed on the head. As a result, existing wearables either compromise comfort or compromise accuracy in tracking sleep variables. We propose PhyMask, an all-textile sleep monitoring solution that is practical and comfortable for continuous use and that acquires all signals of interest to sleep solely using comfortable textile sensors placed on the head. We show that PhyMask can be used to accurately measure all the signals required for precise sleep stage tracking and to extract advanced sleep markers such as spindles and K-complexes robustly in the real-world setting. We validate PhyMask against polysomnography (PSG) and show that it significantly outperforms two commercially-available sleep tracking wearablesâ€”Fitbit and Oura Ring.

“Fake News” and Misinformation can have far-reaching negative social impacts. Scalable fake news classification techniques for resource-poor languages such as Hindi are in their infancy due to the lack of data sets and lack of robust NLP libraries in these languages. We present Aletheia, a Fake News classification system for Hindi. We curate a dataset of approximately 13,000 news articles by media organizations that flag authentic and fake news. We present preliminary results using several Machine Learning models on this dataset. We also developed a system accessible over the web (http://responsible-tech.bits-hyderabad.ac.in/aletheia/demo/) using which users can test if a given piece of news is fake or authentic. We also use the website to collect crowd-sourced labelled news data and present additional information on the dataset and the models to the users.

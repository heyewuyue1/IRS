Efficient signal control at isolated intersections is vital for relieving congestion, accidents, and environmental pollution caused by increasing numbers of vehicles. However, most of the existing studies not only ignore the constraint of the limited computing resources available at isolated intersections but also the matching degree between the signal timing and the traffic demand, leading to high complexity and reduced learning efficiency. In this article, we propose a traffic signal control method based on reinforcement learning with state reduction. First, a reinforcement learning model is established based on historical traffic flow data, and we propose a dual-objective reward function that can reduce vehicle delay and improve the matching degree between signal time allocation and traffic demand, allowing the agent to learn the optimal signal timing strategy quickly. Second, the state and action spaces of the model are preliminarily reduced by selecting a proper control phase combination; then, the state space is further reduced by eliminating rare or nonexistent states based on the historical traffic flow. Finally, a simplified Q-table is generated and used to optimize the complexity of the control algorithm. The results of simulation experiments show that our proposed control algorithm effectively improves the capacity of isolated intersections while reducing the time and space costs of the signal control algorithm.

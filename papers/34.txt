With the down-scaling of CMOS technology, the design complexity of very large-scale integrated is increasing. Although the application of machine learning (ML) techniques in electronic design automation (EDA) can trace its history back to the 1990s, the recent breakthrough of ML and the increasing complexity of EDA tasks have aroused more interest in incorporating ML to solve EDA tasks. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of existing ML for EDA studies, organized following the EDA hierarchy.

In this demo, we present RTAT , a real-time arm tracking system that tracks both orientation and location of a smartwatch simultaneously by a multitask learning neural network. We incorporate an attention layer and design a dedicated loss for the multitask neural network to learn the dynamic relationships among Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. RTAT supports real-time tracking by performing deep learning inference on a smartphone. Finally, to train RTAT , we develop an easy-to-use labeled data collection system that uses a low-cost virtual reality system to measure the ground truth orientation and location of the smartwatch. Extensive experiments show RTAT outperforms significantly the state-of-the-art solutions in inference accuracy and latency.

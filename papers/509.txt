Brain tumors are one of the critical malignant neurological cancers with the highest number of deaths and injuries worldwide. They are categorized into two major classes, high-grade glioma (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG), with HGG being more aggressive and malignant, whereas LGG tumors are less aggressive, but if left untreated, they get converted to HGG. Thus, the classification of brain tumors into the corresponding grade is a crucial task, especially for making decisions related to treatment. Motivated by the importance of such critical threats to humans, we propose a novel framework for brain tumor classification using discrete wavelet transform-based fusion of MRI sequences and Radiomics feature extraction. We utilized the Brain Tumor Segmentation 2018 challenge training dataset for the performance evaluation of our approach, and we extract features from three regions of interest derived using a combination of several tumor regions. We used wrapper method-based feature selection techniques for selecting a significant set of features and utilize various machine learning classifiers, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Extra Randomized Tree for training the model. For proper validation of our approach, we adopt the five-fold cross-validation technique. We achieved state-of-the-art performance considering several performance metrics, 〈 Acc , Sens , Spec , F1-score , MCC , AUC 〉 ≡ 〈 98.60%, 99.05%, 97.33%, 99.05%, 96.42%, 98.19% 〉, where Acc , Sens , Spec , F1-score , MCC , and AUC represents the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient, and area-under-the-curve, respectively. We believe our proposed approach will play a crucial role in the planning of clinical treatment and guidelines before surgery.
